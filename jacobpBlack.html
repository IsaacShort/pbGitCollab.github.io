            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>
                Cloud Computer science involves the utilisation of remote powerful machines rather than
                users relying on local hardware or onsite servers.

                One advantage of cloud computing solutions is that you pay for as much as you need
                if you are a single user you are unlikely to require much processing power, but large 
                companies will require more processing as well as data storage.
