**interest of content**
The subjects of the webpages are areas of computer science that can be found interesting, however there is not much information about the topics in the webpages.
Given more time and chance to add more detail, could become very interesting

**Consistency and quality of visual representation**
Visually, the webpages are all consistent with each other, however the styling is basic. They all use the same .css file and so making the styling more interesting while retaining that consistency should be very simple. The colour choice for the navbar is interesting and not something I would personally choose myself.

**Quality of text representation**
All text can be read and difference between titles and main body are clear.

**Validity of HTML**
All HTML seems valid, although there is no use of something like bootstrap.

**Evidence of collaboration**
Equal input and collaboration evident
