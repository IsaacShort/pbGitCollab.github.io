            <p>
                Aritificial intelligence is defined, by the oxford english dictionary, as 
                the theory and development of computer systems able to perform 
                tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, 
                speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

                An example of a program developed using AI is a 
                <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/">alphazero</a>
                , a chess playing
                computer program developed by DeepMind. AI has been pivotal for the development of
                chess, programs such as stockfish are capable of beating even the
                best chess players.

                But AI has wider applications than just games. AI is used to identify traffic patterns
                to improve navigation routes, translate text between languages and even produce art.
                Despite it's excellent application cases, there are some controversies regarding
                AI, namely the training on the publics work without permission and the biases introduced
                from training AI on various data sets.
